# SortingVisualization
This application is a visualization of the Selection Sort data sorting algorithm.
The initial window has a field for entering the numbers that we want to sort. Initially, it is already filled with some data. But we can change them to any others or click the Create Random button to create a random collection of numbers. 
When you click on the Create button, a new window will be created with blocks of numbers that were in the field for entering them. The size of a block with a number depends on the number itself.
The higher the number, the higher the block itself will be. Initially, the numbers are colored red, which means they are not sorted.
When you click on the Next button, the block will be grayed out, which the algorithm will change with the blue block.
The smallest block in the collection is painted in blue. When you click the Next button again, the blocks will be swapped. After that, the block that is in its place will be colored green, and the algorithm will proceed to the next iteration.
The Create new random button creates a new collection of numbers ready for sorting.
